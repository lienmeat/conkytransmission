v0.5 - Aug 21 2010:
* Has an installation script now!
* Added template engine
* Added command line arguments (run "~/.conkytransmission/conkytransmission.py -h" for details)
* Uses lua_bar instead of execbar by default so that the progress bar can be varied in size easily, instead of having to rely on your default_bar_size param
