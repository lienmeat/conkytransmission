1) install conky (tested with the conky-all package or all compile options on)
2) install transmission-cli and UNINSTALL transmission-daemon if installed
3) in the transmission GUI, go to edit/preferences/Web-tab and enable the web client
4) run install.sh
5) Start conky and transmission and download some torrents!

NOTE:
install.sh will add the lines to ~/.conkyrc that conkytransmission needs to run, but will first backup your existing ~/.conkyrc
file to ~/.conkyrc_bkp.  If you do not have a ~/.conkyrc file, a functional sample file will be created for you

After install, all templates, documentation and sorce code can be located in ~/.conkytransmission
